## VDC Control Panel

The VDC Control Panel provides a web panel to manage a virtual datacenter.

The panel includes a 'technical tutorial' for end users. The content of this technical tutorial can be changed by editing the files in https://github.com/0-complexity/openvcloud_fe/tree/master/Portal/Docs

Third party developers can integrate the VDC Control Panel into their website as documented in the [GitBook for the VDC Control Panel](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-vdc-control-panel)
